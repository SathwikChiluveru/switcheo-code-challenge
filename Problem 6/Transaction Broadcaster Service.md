A transaction broadcaster service is a software system that receives requests to broadcast transactions onto blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, etc.  To guarantee that all network nodes see the same transactions, these transactions should be safely delivered to a broadcast service. Important details such as the receiver, signature, gas costs, and total amount of each transaction will be included in the broadcast data.

The API endpoint (POST /transaction/broadcast) will ensure that the transaction details are received in the form of a JSON payload consisting of important information such as recipient, value, gas fees, etc. This transaction data has to be sent to the broadcaster service so that it can be signed by the user's private key to ensure that the user is the one performing the transaction as well as ensuring that the user is the original owner of the assets under the transaction. Cryptographic algorithms that can perform encryption using the user's private key should be used here so that the transaction data is encrypted. The now signed and encrypted data will be outputted back to the API service and then will be sent to the transaction broadcasting service. 

When the transactions are being fed to the broadcasting service, a queue should be implemented to handle the incoming transactions. A queue would be the best implementation to ensure the first in first out principle. The service will read the transactions from the queue and attempt to broadcast them into the network. The successful transactions will be dequeued, whereas the unsuccessful ones will be retried again. A further implementation could be to include a ranking system to rank which transactions hold more importance and should be processed first using a priority queue. 

To prevent network congestion of the blockchain by constantly retrying unsuccessful transactions, delays should be implemented. For example, when a transaction broadcast is unsuccessful, a retry should take place after 10 seconds (a delay of 10 seconds). The service should continue to broadcast other transactions asynchronously. If the broadcast fails again, there will be a 1-minute cooldown for that specific transaction to be retried again, and so on. If the transaction cooldown reaches around 3 minutes, then it is deemed as a failed transaction. This failed transaction can be stored in a temporary memory and will be dequeued from the broadcasting queue. 

The temporary memory should consist of transactions with their pass or fail status. This implementation could be done in the form of a hashmap. To provide transparency and monitoring capabilities, the broadcaster service should have a transaction status page. This page displays a list of transactions, indicating whether they passed or failed. This temporary memory is helpful for the admins to add this data to the transaction status page, in case they want to access the failed transactions or retry them manually as well. The transaction status can be accessed only by the admins (developers in this case) using a login mechanism.
